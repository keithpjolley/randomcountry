  h1 Random Country
  p I created a list of countries, originally from
  | <a href="https://countries.io">countries.io</a> but then created a
  | static list that may or may not be as complete as countries.io,
  | but, they had a flag. :)  <br/>The new data source is a 
  | <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gallery_of_sovereign_state_flags">Wikipedia</a>
  | article about flags.  You can also point your browser at
  | <a href="https://randomcountry.jamulheavyindustries.com/index.json">randomcountry.jamulheavyindustries.com/index.json</a>
  | to get json data. There's also an Alexa skill called "Random
  | Country".  You can see what I'm feeding it here:
